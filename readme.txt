= Advantages of Botosub plugin =
Your users will enjoy receiving your content. Let people subscribe to your FB page easily with Facebook login and send content instantly instead of forcing users type their email address and check their inbox(which the email may never get delivered). You can also send newsletters automatically when a post/page is published.

= EASY & FAST =
Sending newsletters couldn't be easier. Login to [Botosub](https://www.botosub.com/), choose your FB page. Then enter title, content, image URLs and send to all your Facebook users with a single click. 

= Chatbot subscription advantages =
As of May 2017 there are nearly 2 billion monthly active Facebook users worldwide. Considering the benefits of sharing your content with this community, FB provides huge potential for your business. Also when you send an email newsletter, there is a chance that the user would never see your content because it may land on spam box or just lost in inbox among other emails.

<strong> Things to consider </strong>

* <strong>Facebook page is required in order to send newsletters to Facebook users.</strong>
* <strong>Only users that clicked "Send to Messenger" button can receive chatbot newsletters. Existing FB page followers or users that liked your page should also click "Send to Messenger" button to receive newsletters.</strong>
* <strong>The keys in the Botosub plugin admin panel and [Botosub dashboard](https://www.botosub.com/dashboard.html) should be the same. If the keys are different then Botosub won't send newsletters automatically when a post/page is published.</strong>
